# Market RSI — human progress

This is an append-only plain-language summary, separate from engineering logs.
No entry may turn a diagnostic, infrastructure repair or spent budget into a
claim of prediction improvement. Link detailed evidence rather than pasting it.

## 2026-09-16, work block: stop the iCloud loop

- **Current goal:** Get back to a trustworthy NFL prediction experiment.
- **What I did:** Moved active execution to a non-iCloud local copy; kept the
  original as an archive; made the original budget unable to accept writes;
  restored the scheduled work with local-only instructions.
- **Why:** The previous paid controller stopped when iCloud evicted its source
  during execution. Another identical run would waste money without testing
  the prediction question.
- **What we learned:** The local execution path is usable. We learned nothing
  new about forecast accuracy from this repair.
- **Result:** No meaningful prediction result yet.
- **Evidence:** The original 21-turn controller had no valid decision or model
  fit and cost $1.213125012 incrementally. The local canary passed with zero
  Tinker calls. The migrated $200 ledger reports $89.903153492 effective cost,
  $2.30 still reserved and $107.796846508 globally available; it is not a new
  budget. See `LOCAL_STORAGE_RECOVERY_2026-09-16.md`.
- **Time/effort:** Multiple work blocks across the day; no precise wall-time
  ledger was kept, so a finer claim would be invented.
- **Current blocker:** A frozen, useful target and strong same-row benchmark
  are still missing.
- **Next action:** On opened Train, test target variation and a zero-change
  comparator for the candidate horizons; lock the label rule before matched
  strong baselines.
- **Confidence:** Moderate that this is the right next test; low that the
  current evidence says self-iteration has improved forecasting.

## 2026-09-16, work block: trajectory review

- **Current goal:** Stop measuring activity as if it were research progress.
- **What I did:** Compared the actual run history against the central question,
  recorded a compact decision state, and set review triggers for future work.
- **Why:** The user correctly observed that infrastructure work had displaced
  the next predictive experiment.
- **What we learned:** The best quantitative comparison is still an opened-
  Train HGB/Ridge result; full-season 2024 work measured label availability,
  not a new model's accuracy. There is no active paid run at this review.
- **Result:** Replanned; no new prediction result.
- **Evidence:** HGB 0.0013540355 vs Ridge 0.0016700963 MSE on 2025 opened
  Train; 2024 coverage 67.64% at 60s and 90.87% at 300s over 47,875 timed
  plays. See `RESEARCH_STATE.md` and the daily log.
- **Time/effort:** About one review work block; no paid provider call.
- **Current blocker:** Objective and matched strong baseline not yet frozen.
- **Next action:** Use the already audited coverage counts, then measure target
  variation and a zero-change comparator on opened Train before choosing the
  objective and rerunning all baselines on matching rows.
- **Confidence:** Moderate in the diagnostic priority; unknown that a longer
  horizon will yield better out-of-sample predictability.

## 2026-09-16, work block: make the next test executable

- **Current goal:** Check whether the next target/strong-baseline test can run
  from the repaired local environment.
- **What I did:** Checked the frozen 2024 source commitments and searched the
  local MarketRSI tree for the cohort plan, batch receipts and PBP source.
- **Why:** The next test needs actual opened-Train rows, not just the aggregate
  coverage numbers that were copied for the controller.
- **What we learned:** The local tree has the seven aggregate input receipts but
  not the frozen full-cohort raw source/batches. The audit can be cited, but a
  new target-value or model comparison cannot yet run locally from those files.
- **Result:** Direct blocker identified; no new forecast result.
- **Evidence:** The frozen support lock binds 12 batch manifests and one PBP
  source hash; the local tree contains none of the matching source/batch file
  names. The 284-game audit remains a historical coverage result only.
- **Time/effort:** One bounded file-inventory check; zero paid calls.
- **Current blocker:** Stage only the already-frozen opened-Train source from
  an authorized resident archive with hash checks, without another iCloud
  hydration loop.
- **Next action:** Locate the existing backup of those exact files and verify
  its hashes before copying the minimum needed into the local tree.
- **Confidence:** High that this is a direct prerequisite; it does not yet
  imply the 300-second target is useful or the model improves.
